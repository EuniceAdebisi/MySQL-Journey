# MySQL-Journey

Welcome to my **MySQL Journey** repository! This is where I document my learning and progress with **MySQL**, from basic queries to advanced data analysis and optimization techniques. Each folder contains a specific tutorial or project I've worked on, along with the **SQL queries**, **datasets**, and detailed **explanations**.
